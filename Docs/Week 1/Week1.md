# Week 1 Progress Report

## Introduction

This week, we were introduced to our project, spoke with an AI agent trained to act as our client, and selected the STM32 board we wanted to work with.

## Procedure

During the first week, our group focused on setting up the development environment, selecting the right model STM32 board for our project and becoming familiar with the board and datasheet. The STM32CubeIDE was successfully installed without any issues. This step allowed our group to gain an initial understanding of the tools required for programming and debugging the STM32 Nucleo-144 development board.

## Key Code

- None
    
## Results
By the end of this week, we had our project defined, our board selected, and were set up to begin exploring the software and programming the hardware.
